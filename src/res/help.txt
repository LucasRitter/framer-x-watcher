Basic Usage:
    framerxwatcher <FramerX Project File> <Source Folder> [auth-key] [flags]

    [Coming soon!]
    If the project file doesn't exist yet, you need to specify an auth-key
    for Framer X's package registry. Aternatively, another Framer X project
    can be used.

    If the source folder doesn't exist yet, it'll be automatically created,
    so no worries about that 😊

    To exit the script, use ctrl + c.

Additional Flags (Both Emoji 💁‍ and non-Emoji text works):
    -v    / 📢  : Verbose Mode
    -help / ❓  : This message
    -nn   / 🔕  : Disables notifications

Cool Info:
    This script was made by Lucas Ritter https://github.com/lucasritter,
    who was annoyed that he couldn't properly share the source code of
    some of his projects. He also likes to talk about himself in the
    third person.
