# Update!
Since Framer X v15, you can hold the **âŒ¥** (Options) key on your keyboard and click the `File` menu in the app bar. There'll be an option to `Save As..`. Click that and select the folder format. That feature makes this project obsolete now since that's a much better way to collaborate.

# Framer X Watcher

### What's this? ðŸ¤”
This is a program that watches a .framerx file for changes. Once it notices a change, it will extract the source code to a specified folder. Why, you may ask? To more easily share the source code of a Framer X project or to do better version controlling.
